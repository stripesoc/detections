## Hermetic Wiper Malware Detection Rules
These detection rules are shared in ARM format, this means that you can take them and head to Azure Sentinel -> Analytics -> Import and select these ARM templates.

The file named 'STRSOC-UKR-HermeticWiper-ARMGRP.json' is a group of all of these rules, so you can import this one and it will import all three without you having to.

Should you wish to pick and choose amongst the rules there are 3 seperate rules sorted by class (CL1-3). 

The license of this directory is the same as the parent directory, GPL.
